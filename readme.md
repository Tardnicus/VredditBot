Simple discord bot to save my homies one click.
I didn't like that we had to go outside of Discord whenever someone shared a Reddit-hosted video link just to watch it so I made a bot for it.
Chet basically provides a video for you to watch within Discord so you don't have to click into that one link.

How to use Chet:
You don't need to do anything special. Just post any Reddit links as long as it's a video hosted on Reddit. After a couple seconds, Chet will post a video as a reply to your original message.
Here are some examples of valid links:

Limitations:
Because bots are only allowed to upload 8MB, often times we need to compress these videos down to fit that restriction. For the most part, the compression isn't too noticeable.
However, this means that if the video you're sharing is more than 2-3 minutes or if it's especially high res, there's a highly likelihood that it will come out a bit more pixelated than the original link.
