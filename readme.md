Simple discord bot to save my homies one click.
I hate that I have to click on the reddit link and go to the site itself to watch a reddit-hosted video. This bot:
 - Scans messages for a reddit link.
 - Once it finds one, it looks at the .json data for a v.redd.it link.
 - It then uses youtube-dl to download the video
 - Compresses the video to less than 8MB so we can
 - Upload to Discord as a reply to the original reddit link so users can just watch the video within Discord
